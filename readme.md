Hello, 
this project is intended to do the following things.
* get and clean a DB of all cards in the MTG format know as EDH and or Commander
* then make a db for their appearance and use rate by commander.
* then some fun things with Tesorflow text analysis to ideally
* classify cards as *similar* or *synergistic* to the commander.
* then recommends them based on appearance rate in relation to the above.
* will also have some simpler data analysis and visualizations on the general data at the end though. no fun without that really.

The grand and operative question is always, why?

It also includes text analysis on something similar to legal text without being mind nummingly boring, so a fun learning experience/practice. 
> so yea, if you find it interesting please point out flaws. I know its a mess in there but hey, its a work in progress.

Hello, 
this project is intended to do the following things.
* get and clean a DB of all cards in the MTG format know as EDH and or Commander
* then make a db for their aperance and use rate by commander.
* then some fun things with Tesorflow text analysis to ideally
    * clasify cards as *similar* or *sinergistic* to the commander.
    * then recomends them based on aperance rate in relation to the above.
* will also have some simpler data analysis on the general data at the end though. no fun without that really.
